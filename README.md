## Abstract
This app seeks to aggregate relevant data of Coronavirus infection rates on a by-country basis. Users will be able to view up to date global numbers of how many cases have been confirmed, recovered, and deceased. In addition to being able to find a list of all countries with the most recent updates, users can also click on individual countries to find more detailed information about their cases, as well as add those countries to a 'watch-list'.

## Technologies/Systems

## Set Up

1. Clone down this repo. Since you don't want to name your project "webpack-starter-kit", you can use an optional argument when you run git clone (you replace the [...] with the terminal command arguments): git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]
2. Remove the default remote: git remote rm origin (notice that git remote -v not gives you back nothing)
3. Create a new repo on GitHub with the name of [what you want to name the repo] to be consistent with naming
4. Copy the address that you would use to clone down this repo - something like git@github.com:...
5. Add this remote to your cloned down repo: git remote add origin [address you copied in the previous step] - do not include the brackets
6. Now try to commit something and push it up to your new repo. If everything is setup correctly, you should see the changes on GitHub.
7. Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the project dependencies by running npm install.
8. To verify that it is setup correctly, run npm start in your terminal. Go to http://localhost:8080/ to interact with the application. Enter control + c in your terminal to stop the server at any time.
