# covid-tracker
This project is for the Mod 3 solo project for cohort 2003

### Developer
* [Linus Leas](https://github.com/Leasw144)

## Abstract
This app seeks to aggregate relevant data of Coronavirus infection rates on a by-country basis. Users will be able to view up to date global numbers of how many cases have been confirmed, recovered, and deceased. In addition to being able to find a list of all countries with the most recent updates, users can also click on individual countries to find more detailed information about their cases, as well as add those countries to a 'watch-list'.

## Technologies/Systems
* Javascript
* TDD with Jest and React Test Utils
* React 
* React Router
* CSS
* API Fetch/Post

## Set Up

1. Clone down this repo using `git clone [url] in your terminal
7. Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the project dependencies by running npm install.
8. To verify that it is setup correctly, run npm start in your terminal. Go to http://localhost:3000/ to interact with the application. Enter control + c in your terminal to stop the server at any time.

## Reflections
Testing aside, this project was a fun one to do because it related to something I was interested in which was taking a look at how countries were doing in regards to Coronavirus. The cool thing about the app was that while I was building it out and taking in live data from real sources, I found myself actually using the app to check on the certain countries I was interested in. 

For the project before this one, my stretch technology that we had decided to learn was Vue so unfortunately, no new technologies were implemented for this project. That being said, my understanding of React was enforced a bit more in terms of how data travels between components. My knowledge on testing was still a bit shaky going into this project and while I did improve my conceptual understanding to an extent in this project, it's something I still need work on in order to make more accurate and robust testing. 

### Future Iterations
Given the opportunity to revisit this project, I would like to add a sorting feature that allows users to sort by the number of cases a country might have. Additional ideas would be to calculate percent changes of a country between given dates as well as compare countries by a per capita basis. On a more technical level, more robust testing is clearly needed along with sad path testing that is also reflected in the DOM.
